Description: Fonts with the same metrics as Times, Arial and Courier
 A set of serif, sans-serif and monospaced fonts from Red Hat with
 exactly the same metrics as the (non-free) Microsoft Times, Arial
 and Courier fonts, which implies those fonts can serve as a drop-in
 replacement. The font family is named Liberation.
